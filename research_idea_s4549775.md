# Topic

I want to investigate whether the proposed IPv10 standard solves the communication and transition problems between IPv4 and IPv6, that it claims to solve.

Should the IPv10 draft be accepted and implemented as a solution to the current communication and transition problems between IPv4 and IPv6?

# Problem

Does IPv10 meet its declared goals?

* Is the proposed solution more efficient than currently used ones?
* Does it allow for communication between all types of hosts?
	* IPv4 / IPv4
	* IPv4 / IPv6
	* IPv6 / IPv4
	* IPv6 / IPv6
* Does it increase flexibility when using DNS?
* Does it solve the transition problem?
* Is it easy to deploy to all Internet connected hosts?
