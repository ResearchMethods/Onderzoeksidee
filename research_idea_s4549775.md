# Topic

I want to investigate whether the proposed IPv10 standard solves the communication and transition problems between IPv4 and IPv6, that it claims to solve.

Should the IPv10 draft be accepted and implemented as a solution to the current communication and transition problems between IPv4 and IPv6?
